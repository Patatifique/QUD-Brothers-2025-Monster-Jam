[h1]2025 Monster Jam: Puppet Stalks[/h1]

This mod adds a new fungal infection, the puppet stalks, turning both infected creatures and corpses touched by its spores into dybbuks, dangerous fungal revenants. Follow a short quest that pops up during Qud's main quest to discover what remains of a Barathrumite expedition to the ruined village of Nodd, and face the fungi!

You will find below a non-exhaustive list of the mod's features.

[h2]New Creatures[/h2]
[h3]Brooding Umberpuff[/h3]
The [b]brooding umberpuff[/b] is a new puffing mushroom that recently settled in Qud. Although similar in appearance to the rest of its kind, its spores carry with them the dangerous [b]puppet stalks[/b] infection.

[h3]Dybbuk[/h3]
Whenever a creature infected by puppet stalks dies, it turns into a dangerous [b]dybbuk[/b], a shambling corpse hosting the parasitic fungi. Spores also settle on corpses, reanimating them in a similar fashion.

[h2]New Items[/h2]
[list][*]The [b]puppet stalks[/b], a fungal infection that raises dybbuks from its host and its surroundings;
[*]The [b]plastifer hazard suit[/b], a full-body suit that protects you from spores and gases.[/list]

[h2]New Quest and Location[/h2]
Right before heading to Bethesda Suda, Q Girl will direct you to Hortensa. The Barathrumite will ask you to look for the whereabouts of an expedition that made its way to the village of Nodd. Find out what happened to the tinkers, and save whatever you can from this sultanforsaken place.
