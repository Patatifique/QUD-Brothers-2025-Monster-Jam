			Work indeed,=name=. Some weeks ago, an expedition of tinkers went to the village of Nodd on the edges of the Rainbow Wood, where some form of new fungal infection had been spotted. They ought to be back by now, but as you can see, there is no sign of them.

			I shudder to think of it, cub, but that may very well be the case. Would you check on them, please? I will hold some hope in my heart, but should the worst have arrived, I trust you to recover their expedition logs.

			<text>
			Is my worry that obvious? But yes, if that is not too much to ask, cub. Should their fate be as dire as I fear, would you recover their expedition logs?

			You have my thanks, =name=. I will see what we can learn from this. In the meantime, please take my old hazard suit. It should help you in case of any more run-ins with fungi.
